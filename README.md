VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

Files Included:
  1. VBA Script -
    a. Sub - "ticker_fun_all_ws"
  2. Word Doc with Screenshots of Results - "Stock_Data_Results_Screenshots"
  3. Full file and results - "Multiple_year_stock_data_VBA_of_Wall_Street_Alec_Miller"
 
General Notes:
- Project closely aligned to previous VBA experience using loops to maniuplate large amounts of data. 
- I am seeing extreme latency issues using this type of code.
- Wouldn't it be a lot easier to code in a pivot table first?
